Here’s a well-structured and impressive README file for your Streamlit-based **Air Quality Prediction** project:

---

# 🌍 Air Quality Prediction in Urban Areas  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Streamlit web application** that predicts **PM2.5 levels** based on environmental and traffic data. It utilizes **Machine Learning (Random Forest Regressor)** to provide real-time air quality predictions based on user inputs or uploaded datasets.  

## ⚙️ Features  
✔️ Upload air quality datasets in CSV format  
✔️ Train a **Random Forest Regressor** model for PM2.5 prediction  
✔️ Evaluate model performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R² Score**  
✔️ Display **feature importance** using Seaborn visualizations  
✔️ Allow users to **input real-time data** for air quality predictions  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)  
- **Streamlit** (for the interactive web app)  
- **Machine Learning** (Random Forest Regressor)  
- **Joblib** (for model saving & loading)  

## 📂 Dataset Requirements  
The uploaded CSV file should contain the following columns:  
- `Traffic_Volume`  
- `Temperature`  
- `Humidity`  
- `Wind_Speed`  
- `NO2`  
- `CO`  
- `PM10`  
- `PM2.5` (Target Variable)  

## 🚀 Installation & Usage  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-prediction.git
cd air-quality-prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🏗 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Add support for **Deep Learning models** (e.g., LSTMs for time series forecasting)  
🔹 Incorporate **real-time air quality API data**  
🔹 Deploy on **AWS/GCP/Azure**
